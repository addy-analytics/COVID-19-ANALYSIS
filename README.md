# COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python

##### Analysis of confirmed cases, reported fatalities, and reported recoveries from the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)

This analysis uses time series data to monitor the number of COVID-19 victims throughout the world. It also aims to look at:
- tested instances of proven Coronavirus infection
- the number of persons who have reportedly passed away from coronavirus infections
- how many individuals have reportedly recovered from it
- how the effect of lockdown impacted on the spread of COVID-19

You can find the raw data & official analysis [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/main/data/countries-aggregated.csv). This Notebook makes use of Python packages like Pandas (for Data Cleaning/Manipulation) and Plotly-plotly.express and Seaborn (for Data Visualization).

# Conclusion
- Considering a nation like Italy, the results of this exploratory data analysis show that lockdowns were successful in lowering the incidence of COVID-19 and preventing the spread of the disease among the local populations. Here, we discovered that the enforced lockdown witnessed a slower growth in COVID-19 rates throughout the first month and a lower count but inconsistent from 30th October2020 across all time periods. A significant increase did occur in January 2022, though. This could be because COVID 19 variations that have appeared and were not considered in this research.

- Contrary to Italy and maybe other nations, the partial lockdown in some areas of the Ghana may have assisted in slowing the spread of COVID-19, although not entirely, as we can observe an intermittent spike and decrease in instances. Due of the potential harm to its economy and other factors, Ghana was unable to enforce a complete lockdown. Over time, however, the government started to register instances in all 16 of its regions. This may account for the fluctuating rise and decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases that have been reported.

# Limitation
It would have been helpful if there was sufficient data on the various regions of Ghana to evaluate the rise and fall of the virus and perhaps put the introduction of lockdown and its effect as at the time it was implemented in other regions into perspective in order to accurately assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown in Ghana.

# Future Work
Evaluating the impact of vaccination on the death rate as well as how it has contributed to halt or decrease the spread of Covid-19.
